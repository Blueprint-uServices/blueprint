# leaf application

Leaf is a simple application that is not representative of a real application.  Its intended use is to provide examples of Blueprint API usage; it is frequently referenced by plugin documentation.

For a more realistic application to run, look at the [sockshop](../sockshop) or [dsb_sn](../dsb_sn), or other applications listed in the [examples](..) directory.
