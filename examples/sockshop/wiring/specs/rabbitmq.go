// A wiring spec that deploys each service into its own Docker container and using gRPC to communicate between services.
// All RPC calls are retried up to 3 times.  RPC clients use a client pool with 10 clients.
// All services are instrumented with OpenTelemetry and traces are exported to Zipkin
// The user, cart, shipping, and orders services using separate MongoDB instances to store their data.
// The catalogue service uses MySQL to store catalogue data.
// The shipping service and queue master service run within the same process (TODO: separate processes)
