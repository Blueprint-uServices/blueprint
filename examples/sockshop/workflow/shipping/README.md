# shipping

```go
import "github.com/Blueprint-uServices/blueprint/examples/sockshop/workflow/shipping"
```

Package shipping implements the SockShop shipping microservice.

All the shipping microservice does is push the shipment to a queue. The queue\-master service pulls shipments from the queue and "processes" them.
