# Examples

This directory contains some example Blueprint applications, primarily for use in getting started with Blueprint.

- [sockshop](sockshop) re-implements the SockShop microservices benchmark
- [dsb_hotel](dsb_hotel) re-implements the hotel-reservation application from the DeathStarBench microservices benchmark
- [dsb_sn](dsb_sn) re-implements the social-network application from the DeathStarBench microservices benchmark
- [train_ticket](train_ticket) re-implements the TrainTicket microservices benchmark

- [leaf](leaf) is a two-service application where one service calls the other; this is intended to be used to demo Blueprint features and not as a meaningful microservice application.
