# wiring

This directory contains the wiring logic for the Hotel Reservation application. Wiring specs define the topology and deployment of services.

To display options and usage, invoke:

```
go run main.go -h
```

## Compiling with a specific wiring spec

To compile the application with a specific wiring spec (e.g., `chain`, `fanin`, `fanout`), run:

```
go run main.go -w <spec> -o build_<spec>
```

**Note:**
- You must specify the correct spec name using the `-w` flag, or by editing the wiring file to set the desired experiment.
- Alternatively, you can change the default experiment by editing the spec in `main.go` (e.g., change `specs.Fanout` to `specs.Chain`, `specs.Original`, or `specs.Fanin`).
- If you add or modify a wiring spec in `specs/`, you must recompile using the above command.
- If you add or update a plugin (such as CRISP for critical path analysis), you must rebuild its Docker image (see the main README for details).

See the main README in the parent directory for full instructions on running the application and analyzing traces.
