# specs

This directory contains wiring specs for different service topologies (experiments) in the Hotel Reservation application.

## Available wiring specs

- `original`: Full DeathStarBench topology (all services, all dependencies)
- `chain`: Frontend → Search → Geo (sequential chain)
- `fanin`: Search → Geo, Profile → Geo (fan-in pattern)
- `fanout`: Frontend calls all backends directly (star topology)

## Adding or modifying a wiring spec

- Add a new `.go` file in this directory, following the pattern of the existing specs.
- Register your spec in the `main.go` file if needed.
- After adding or modifying a spec, recompile the application:
  ```
  go run ../main.go -w <your_spec> -o build_<your_spec>
  ```
- You must specify the correct spec name using the `-w` flag, or by editing the wiring file to set the desired experiment.
- Alternatively, you can change the default experiment by editing the spec in `../main.go` (e.g., change `specs.Fanout` to `specs.Chain`, `specs.Original`, or `specs.Fanin`).
- If your spec uses a new or updated plugin (e.g., CRISP), rebuild its Docker image as described in the main README.

## Purpose

Each wiring spec allows you to experiment with different microservice topologies and analyze their impact on the critical path and system reliability.

```go
import "github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/examples/dsb_hotel/wiring/specs"

## Variables

<a name="Original"></a>Wiring spec that represents the original configuration of the HotelReservation application. Each service is deployed in a separate container with all inter\-service communication happening via GRPC. FrontEnd service provides a http frontend for making requests. All services are instrumented with opentelemetry tracing with spans being exported to a central Jaeger collector.

```go
var Original = cmdbuilder.SpecOption{
    Name:        "original",
    Description: "Deploys the original configuration of the DeathStarBench application.",
    Build:       makeOriginalSpec,
}
```
