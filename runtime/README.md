# runtime

```go
import "github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/runtime"
```

Package runtime contains interfaces and implementations that are used by compiled Blueprint applications at runtime

During compilation, Blueprint's compiler will take code from this module and include it into the compiled output. This is primarily implemented by the [golang/goparser](<https://github.com/Blueprint-uServices/blueprint/tree/main/plugins/golang/goparser>) and [workflowspec](<https://github.com/Blueprint-uServices/blueprint/tree/main/plugins/workflowspec>) plugins

[runtime/core/backend](<https://github.com/Blueprint-uServices/blueprint/tree/main/runtime/core/backend>) defines the backend interfaces used by workflow specs. A workflow spec implementation might want to import that package and use the interfaces defined there.

[plugins](<https://github.com/Blueprint-uServices/blueprint/tree/main/runtime/plugins>) defines implementations that are used by plugins and automatically compiled into the application. These should not need to be directly reference by workflow specs.
