# Runtime

This module contains interfaces that are used by Blueprint applications at runtime, i.e. in an application's workflow spec, and in the code generated by Blueprint's compiler.

A workflow spec can import and use code from this package.  For example, [runtime/core/backend](core/backend) defines the interfaces `backend.Cache` and `backend.NoSQLDB` that are frequently used by applications.

Plugins can also define, import and use code from this package.

Within this module, code is broadly divided according to the intended user:
 - [core](core) is primarily intended for use by an application's workflow specs
 - [plugins](plugins) is primarily intended for use by plugin-generated code
