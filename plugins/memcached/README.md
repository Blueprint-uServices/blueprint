# Memcached

The Blueprint memcached plugin provides a memcached server process and a client.

It implements the cache stdlib interface.

TODO: not-implemented-yet: This plugin is basically unimplemented; the code-generation portion and stdlib interfaces are unimplemented.  Implementing this plugin will be a forcing function for establishing the stdlib interfaces and on non-gocode artifact generation
