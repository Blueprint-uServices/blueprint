# dockercompose

```go
import "github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/plugins/dockercompose"
```

Package dockercompose is a plugin for instantiating multiple container instances in a single docker\-compose deployment.

### Wiring Spec Usage

To use the dockercompose plugin in your wiring spec, you can declare a deployment, giving it a name and specifying which container instances to include

```
dockercompose.NewDeployment(spec, "my_deployment", "my_container_1", "my_container_2")
```

You can add containers to existing deployments:

```
dockercompose.AddContainerToDeployment(spec, "my_deployment", "my_container_3")
```

To deploy an application\-level service in a container, make sure you first deploy the service to a process \(with the [goproc](<https://github.com/Blueprint-uServices/blueprint/tree/main/plugins/goproc>) plugin\) and to a container image \(with the [linuxcontainer](<https://github.com/Blueprint-uServices/blueprint/tree/main/plugins/linuxcontainer>) plugin\)

The dockercompose plugin can be configured as the default builder for container instances; at compile time, Blueprint will combine any container instances that exist in the wiring spec but aren't explicitly added to a container deployment, and create a default docker\-compose deployment with the name "docker".

```
dockercompose.RegisterAsDefaultBuilder()
```

Calling the above is optional. If your wiring spec uses the \[cmdbuilder\] then dockercompose is already registered as the default container workspace builder.

### Artifacts Generated

During compilation, the plugin generates a docker\-compose file that instantiates images for the specified containers. The plugin also sets environment variables and ports for the instances.

If your wiring spec only defines container instances, and dockercompose is registered as the default builder, then Blueprint will automatically generate a docker\-compose deployment called "docker" that instantiates all of the container instances.

### Running Artifacts

If the dockercompose deployment is not further combined by other plugins, then the entry point to running your application will be using docker\-compose. You can build or run the deployment with:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Although the plugin automatically assigns and sets hostnames and ports for containers, you will still need to set some environment variables for ports to expose on the local host. If you try to build or run the docker\-compose file when these are absent, Docker will complain about their absence. You can write these to a .env file or set them in your local environment.

For a concrete guide on running a generated docker\-compose file, see the [SockShop Getting Started](<https://github.com/Blueprint-uServices/blueprint/tree/main/examples/sockshop>) documentation.

### Internals

Internally, the plugin makes use of interfaces defined in the [docker](<https://github.com/Blueprint-uServices/blueprint/tree/main/plugins/docker>) plugin. It can combine any Container IRNodes including ones that use off\-the\-shelf container images, and ones that generate their own container image \(Dockerfile\) onto the local filesystem. Internally the plugin assigns hostnames to container instances and sets environment variables so that services call to the correct hostnames and ports.

<a name="AddContainerToDeployment"></a>
## func [AddContainerToDeployment](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/plugins/dockercompose/wiring.go#L75>)

```go
func AddContainerToDeployment(spec wiring.WiringSpec, deploymentName, containerName string)
```

Adds containerName to the existing container deployment deploymentName, which was previously created using [NewDeployment](<#NewDeployment>)

<a name="NewDeployment"></a>
## func [NewDeployment](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/plugins/dockercompose/wiring.go#L87>)

```go
func NewDeployment(spec wiring.WiringSpec, deploymentName string, containers ...string) string
```

Creates a new container deployment called \[deploymentName\] that will instantiate the container instances given in containers.

Further container instances can be added to the deployment by calling [AddContainerToDeployment](<#AddContainerToDeployment>).

During compilation, generates a docker\-compose file that instantiates the containers.

Returns deploymentName.

<a name="RegisterAsDefaultBuilder"></a>
## func [RegisterAsDefaultBuilder](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/plugins/dockercompose/defaults.go#L18>)

```go
func RegisterAsDefaultBuilder()
```

RegisterAsDefaultBuilder should be invoked by a wiring spec if it wishes to use docker\-compose as the default way of combining container instances.

If you are using the \[cmdbuilder\], then docker\-compose is automatically set as the default builder and you do not need to call this function again.

Default builders are responsible for building any container instances that exist in a wiring spec but aren't explicitly added to a container deployment within that wiring spec. The Blueprint compiler groups these "floating" container instances into a default dockercompose deployment with the name "docker".

<a name="Deployment"></a>
## type [Deployment](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/plugins/dockercompose/ir.go#L9-L16>)

An IRNode representing a docker\-compose deployment, which is simply a collection of container instances.

```go
type Deployment struct {
    DeploymentName string
    Nodes          []ir.IRNode
    Edges          []ir.IRNode
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
