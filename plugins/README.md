# Plugins

Much of Blueprint's features and functionality are implemented by plugins contained in this module.

Each plugin resides in its own subdirectory and provides its own documentation.

The Blueprint [User Manual](../docs/manual/plugins.md) provides a high-level overview of some of the more prominent plugins.

If you want to develop your own plugin, it is not mandatory for the plugin to live in this directory.  It can reside in a different repository and module.
