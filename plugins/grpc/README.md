# grpc

```go
import "gitlab.mpi-sws.org/cld/blueprint/plugins/grpc"
```

Package grpc implements a Blueprint plugin that enables any Golang service to be deployed using a gRPC server.

To use the plugin in a Blueprint wiring spec, import this package and use the [Deploy](<#Deploy>) method, ie.

```
import "gitlab.mpi-sws.org/cld/blueprint/plugins/grpc"
grpc.Deploy(spec, "my_service")
```

See the documentation for [Deploy](<#Deploy>) for more information about its behavior.

The plugin implements gRPC code generation, as well as generating a server\-side handler and client\-side library that calls the server. This is implemented within the \[grpccodegen\] package.

To use this plugin requires the protocol buffers and grpc compilers are installed on the machine that is compiling the Blueprint wiring spec. Installation instructions can be found on the \[gRPC Quick Start\].

## func Deploy

```go
func Deploy(spec wiring.WiringSpec, serviceName string)
```

Deploys \`serviceName\` as a GRPC server.

Typically serviceName should be the name of a workflow service that was initially defined using \[workflow.Define\].

Like many other modifiers, GRPC modifies the service at the golang level, by generating server\-side handler code and a client\-side library. However, GRPC should be the last golang\-level modifier applied to a service, because thereafter communication between the client and server is no longer at the golang level, but at the network level.

Deploying a service with GRPC increases the visibility of the service within the application. By default, any other service running in any other container or namespace can now contact this service.
