<a name="Container"></a>
## type [Container](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/plugins/docker/ir.go#L11-L14>)

The base IRNode interface for docker containers

```go
type Container interface {
    ir.IRNode
    ImplementsDockerContainer()
}
```

<a name="ContainerWorkspace"></a>
## type [ContainerWorkspace](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/plugins/docker/ir.go#L51-L115>)

Builders used by the above code and artifact generation interfaces

```go

    	Creates a subdirectory in the workspace dir for a container node

<a name="ContainerWorkspaceInfo"></a>
## type [ContainerWorkspaceInfo](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/plugins/docker/ir.go#L39-L42>)

Builders used by the above code and artifact generation interfaces

```go
type ContainerWorkspaceInfo struct {
    Path   string // fully-qualified path on the filesystem to the workspace
    Target string // the type of workspace being built
}
```

<a name="ProcessWorkspace"></a>
## type [ProcessWorkspace](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/plugins/docker/ir.go#L130-L166>)

Docker also specializes the build process for linux containers.

```
Concretely, processes can add custom build commands to the Dockerfile.

We support docker multi-stage builds, where a process can build its
binaries in one stage, and then we copy the built output into a
different image in the next stage.

To make use of this, a process that implements linux.ProvidesProcessArtifacts
or linux.InstantiableProcess can typecheck the workspace argument
to see if it is a docker.ProcessWorkspace instance.
```

```go
type ProcessWorkspace interface {
    linux.ProcessWorkspace

    /*
    	Called by a process IRNode to add custom Dockerfile commands to
    	the Dockerfile.

    	Specifically the commands are assumed to be part of a Docker
    	multi-stage build
    	https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/

    	If a process does NOT add Dockerfile commands, then by default
    	the process artifacts will simply be copied into the container.

    	If a process DOES add Dockerfile commands, then it is responsible
    	for which artifacts make it into the container.

    	The caller should assume the following:
    	 * The Dockerfile will reside in the root of the process workspace
    	 * Thus process artifacts will reside in the appropriate subdirectory
    	   of the process workspace

    	The caller must ensure the following:
    	 * The Dockerfile commands should begin with
    	 	FROM imagename AS {procname}
    	 * {procname} must be the process IRnode's name
    	 * Any build artifacts that should survive into the final container
    	   must be placed in the /{procname} directory

    	The generated Dockerfile will automatically copy built artifacts
    	into the final container as follows:
    		COPY --from={procname} /{procname} /{procname}
    */
    AddDockerfileCommands(procName, commands string)

    ImplementsDockerProcessWorkspace()
}
```

<a name="ProvidesContainerImage"></a>
## type [ProvidesContainerImage](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/plugins/docker/ir.go#L26-L28>)

For container nodes that want to provide code or other

```
artifacts for their container.  Methods on the `builder` argument
are used for collecting the artifacts
```

```go
type ProvidesContainerImage interface {
    AddContainerArtifacts(target ContainerWorkspace) error
}
```

<a name="ProvidesContainerInstance"></a>
## type [ProvidesContainerInstance](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/plugins/docker/ir.go#L30-L32>)

Code and artifact generation interfaces that IRNodes can implement to provide docker images

```go
type ProvidesContainerInstance interface {
    AddContainerInstance(target ContainerWorkspace) error
}
```
