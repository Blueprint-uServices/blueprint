<a name="Container"></a>
## type Container

The base IRNode interface for docker containers

```go
type Container interface {
    core.ContainerNode
    ImplementsDockerContainer()
}
```

<a name="ContainerWorkspace"></a>
## type ContainerWorkspace

Builders used by the above code and artifact generation interfaces

```go
type ContainerWorkspace interface {
    blueprint.BuildContext

    Info() ContainerWorkspaceInfo

    /*
    	Creates a subdirectory in the workspace dir for a container node
    	to collect its artifacts

    	Returns a fully qualified path on the local filesystem where artifacts will be
    	collected.
    */
    CreateImageDir(imageName string) (string, error)

    /*
    	Declares an instance of a container with a desired name, using
    	a pre-existing image.

    	The instanceName will be used as the container hostname.

    	The IRnodes provided are considered arguments to the container.  If they
    	are Config IRNodes, environment variables will be set for the container instance.
    	If they are addresses, ports will be assigned and mapped.

    	Returns an error if an instance already exists with this name.
    */
    DeclarePrebuiltInstance(instanceName string, image string, args ...blueprint.IRNode) error

    /*
    	Declares an instance of a container using container artifacts
    	on the local filesystem.  The specified imageName must correspond
    	to the imageName used in a previous call to CreateImageDir.

    	The instanceName will be used as the container hostname.

    	The IRnodes provided are considered arguments to the container.  If they
    	are Config IRNodes, environment variables will be set for the container instance.
    	If they are addresses, ports will be assigned and mapped.

    */
    DeclareLocalImage(instanceName string, imageName string, args ...blueprint.IRNode) error

    /*
    	Indicates that the caller has finished adding images and instances,
    	and the workspace can generate any subsequent artifacts
    	e.g. the final docker-compose file can be generated
    */
    Finish() error

    ImplementsContainerWorkspace()
}
```

<a name="ContainerWorkspaceInfo"></a>
## type ContainerWorkspaceInfo

Builders used by the above code and artifact generation interfaces

```go
type ContainerWorkspaceInfo struct {
    Path   string // fully-qualified path on the filesystem to the workspace
    Target string // the type of workspace being built
}
```

<a name="ProcessWorkspace"></a>
## type ProcessWorkspace

Docker also specializes the build process for linux containers.

```
Concretely, processes can add custom build commands to the Dockerfile.

We support docker multi-stage builds, where a process can build its
binaries in one stage, and then we copy the built output into a
different image in the next stage.

To make use of this, a process that implements linux.ProvidesProcessArtifacts
or linux.InstantiableProcess can typecheck the workspace argument
to see if it is a docker.ProcessWorkspace instance.
```

```go
type ProcessWorkspace interface {
    linux.ProcessWorkspace

    /*
    	Called by a process IRNode to add custom Dockerfile commands to
    	the Dockerfile.

    	Specifically the commands are assumed to be part of a Docker
    	multi-stage build
    	https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/

    	If a process does NOT add Dockerfile commands, then by default
    	the process artifacts will simply be copied into the container.

    	If a process DOES add Dockerfile commands, then it is responsible
    	for which artifacts make it into the container.

    	The caller should assume the following:
    	 * The Dockerfile will reside in the root of the process workspace
    	 * Thus process artifacts will reside in the appropriate subdirectory
    	   of the process workspace

    	The caller must ensure the following:
    	 * The Dockerfile commands should begin with
    	 	FROM imagename AS {procname}
    	 * {procname} must be the process IRnode's name
    	 * Any build artifacts that should survive into the final container
    	   must be placed in the /{procname} directory

    	The generated Dockerfile will automatically copy built artifacts
    	into the final container as follows:
    		COPY --from={procname} /{procname} /{procname}
    */
    AddDockerfileCommands(procName, commands string)

    ImplementsDockerProcessWorkspace()
}
```

<a name="ProvidesContainerImage"></a>
## type ProvidesContainerImage

For container nodes that want to provide code or other

```
artifacts for their container.  Methods on the `builder` argument
are used for collecting the artifacts
```

```go
type ProvidesContainerImage interface {
    AddContainerArtifacts(target ContainerWorkspace) error
}
```

<a name="ProvidesContainerInstance"></a>
## type ProvidesContainerInstance

Code and artifact generation interfaces that IRNodes can implement to provide docker images

```go
type ProvidesContainerInstance interface {
    AddContainerInstance(target ContainerWorkspace) error
}
```
