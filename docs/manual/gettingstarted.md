# Getting Started with Blueprint

## Prerequisites

To run the example applications, you will need to install the recommended [prerequisites](requirements.md).

## Applications

Blueprint has a number of out-of-the-box applications, listed in the [examples](../../examples) directory.

To get started, we will compile and run the SockShop application.  Navigate to the [SockShop](../../examples/sockshop) directory and follow the directions there.

## Modify SockShop

The SockShop documentation describes how to compile the `docker` spec.  However, other specs exist for SockShop (in the [specs](../../examples/sockshop/wiring/specs/)) directory.  These demonstrate different ways of modifying and instantiating services.
