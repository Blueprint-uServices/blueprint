# Getting Started with Blueprint

## Run SockShop

Start with the [SockShop](../../examples/sockshop) application.  The documentation of the example application describes how to compile and run the application.

## Modify SockShop

The SockShop documentation describes how to compile the `docker` spec.  However, other specs exist for SockShop (in the [specs](../../examples/sockshop/wiring/specs/)) directory.  These demonstrate different ways of modifying and instantiating services.
