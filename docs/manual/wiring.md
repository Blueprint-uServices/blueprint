# Wiring Spec

We recommend using the [SockShop](../../examples/sockshop/) application as a template.

You can create new wiring specs by following the approach in the [wiring/specs](../../examples/sockshop/wiring/specs) directory and then adding the spec in [wiring/main.go](../../examples/sockshop/wiring/main.go).

TODO: an explanation of the compiler output when compiling wiring specs, particularly the application structure, and what it means.
