# Blueprint

Blueprint is:
 * A collection of microservice benchmark applications
 * A library that simplifies developing new microservice applications
 * A tool for easily reconfiguring the frameworks, infrastructure, and deployment of a microservice application
 * A platform for prototyping new microservice infrastructure and integrating it with existing applications

Blueprint is particularly aimed at **prototyping and experimentation** use cases.  It is intended for use by anybody, but particularly researchers and practitioners wanting to experiment with microservice applications.

Blueprint actually is:
 * An extensible compiler for microservice applications

Its central goal is to reduce the amount of effort involved when changing and re-compiling the infrastructure choices of a microservice application.  

See [Getting Started](docs/gettingstarted.md) to get started with Blueprint.
