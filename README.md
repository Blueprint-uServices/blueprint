# Blueprint

Blueprint is an extensible compiler for microservice applications, along with a collection of off-the-shelf microservice benchmark applications.

Using Blueprint, you can:
 * Run a number of off-the-shelf microservice applications and use them for your benchmarking, prototyping, and research experimentation.
 * Change and reconfigure those off-the-shelf applications, so that they use different frameworks, infrastructure, and deployment choices.
 * Easily develop your own microservice applications and leverage Blueprint's built-in features that decouple your application's logic from (Blueprint-generated) boilerplate.
 * Prototype and develop your own microservice *infrastructure*, and integrate and evaluate your infrastructure with all of the existing applications.

Blueprint is particularly aimed at **prototyping and experimentation** use cases.  It is intended for use by anybody, but particularly researchers and practitioners wanting to experiment with microservice applications.  Its central goal is to reduce the amount of effort involved when changing and re-compiling the infrastructure choices of a microservice application.  

## Status

Blueprint is currently pre-release with most initial features implemented.  However, some features may not be implemented yet, some applications may be incomplete, and some aspects of the user guide may be empty.  Please join the [blueprint-uservices](https://blueprint-uservices.slack.com/) Slack if you have any questions, requests, or comments.

## Getting Started

See the 📖[Getting Started](docs/manual/gettingstarted.md) page of the User Manual to get started compiling and running your first Blueprint application.

## Project

If you anticipate making use of Blueprint for your research project, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the SOSP 2023 publication below, which outlines and demonstrates some motivating use cases for Blueprint.

📄[Blueprint: A Toolchain for Highly-Reconfigurable Microservices](https://blueprint-uservices.github.io/assets/pdf/anand2023blueprint.pdf)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaastav Anand, Deepak Garg, Antoine Kaufmann, Jonathan Mace\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*29th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP '23)*

If you are looking for the artifact that was evaluated for the SOSP paper, it can be found [here](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/cld/blueprint), though it is not maintained.  Instead we recommend using the Blueprint implementation contained in this repository.
