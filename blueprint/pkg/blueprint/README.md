```go
import "github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blueprint/pkg/blueprint"
```

Package blueprint provides some common utility methods for logging, io, errors and string manipulation.

## Index

- [Constants](<#constants>)
- [func Errorf\(format string, a ...any\) error](<#Errorf>)


## Constants

<a name="MAX_ERR_SIZE"></a>

```go
const (
    MAX_ERR_SIZE = 2048
)
```

<a name="Errorf"></a>
## func [Errorf](<https://github.com/blueprint-uservices/blueprint/blob/main/blueprint/pkg/blueprint/errors.go#L30>)

```go
func Errorf(format string, a ...any) error
```

Generates an error in the same way as fmt.Errorf but also includes the call stack.

Plugins should generally use this method, because it enables us to more easily tie errors back to the plugins and wiring specs that caused the error.
